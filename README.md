# @daytona/n8n-nodes-daytona

The official [Daytona](https://www.daytona.io) community node for [n8n](https://n8n.io).

## Overview

[Daytona](https://www.daytona.io) provides secure, elastic sandbox infrastructure for AI agents. Each sandbox is a complete, isolated environment that is fully programmable, spun up on demand, and built for autonomous use without human intervention.

Using n8n, you can integrate Daytona into any automated workflow: create sandboxes from snapshots or custom Docker images, clone repositories, execute code and shell commands, expose running services via preview URLs, upload and download files, and manage the full sandbox lifecycle — all as composable steps alongside thousands of other n8n nodes.

## Installation

Once published, install from inside n8n:

1. Go to **Settings → Community Nodes**.
2. Click **Install a community node**.
3. Enter `@daytona/n8n-nodes-daytona` and click **Install**.
4. The Daytona node appears in the node search panel after refresh.

For local development against an unpublished version, see [Development](#development).

## Credentials

Create an API key at [app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys](https://app.daytona.io/dashboard/keys), then add a **Daytona API** credential in n8n.

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **API Key** | Yes | Bearer token from the Daytona dashboard. Stored encrypted by n8n. |
| **Base URL** | No (default `https://app.daytona.io/api`) | Override only when targeting a self-hosted Daytona instance. |
| **Organization ID** | No | Required when authenticating with a JWT token. Always safe to set with an API key — Daytona accepts the header on every request. Sent as `X-Daytona-Organization-ID`. |

The credential is verified against `GET /api-keys/current` when you save — n8n reports success or failure inline.

## Operations

| Resource | Operation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Sandbox** | Create | Create a sandbox. Set **Snapshot** (pre-built template ID/name) or **Image** (Docker image reference like `python:3.11`). Snapshot takes precedence if both are set; if neither is set, Daytona's organization default snapshot is used. Optional name, ephemeral flag, and advanced options (CPU/memory/disk, region, env vars, labels, network policy, auto-stop/archive/delete intervals). Optional poll-until-`started`. |
| | Get | Fetch a single sandbox by ID. |
| | Get Many | List sandboxes (paginated when **Return All** is checked). |
| | Delete | Permanently delete a sandbox. |
| | Start | Start a stopped sandbox. Optional poll-until-`started`. |
| | Stop | Stop a running sandbox. Optional poll-until-`stopped`. |
| | Get Preview URL | Generate a public URL for a port exposed inside a sandbox. **Signed** (default, browser-friendly, token in URL) or **Standard** (token returned separately, sent via `x-daytona-preview-token` header). |
| **Code** | Run Code | Execute Python, JavaScript, or TypeScript inside a sandbox. With **Use Ephemeral Sandbox** checked (default), creates a temporary sandbox just for this execution and auto-deletes afterward. |
| | Run Command | Execute a shell command inside a sandbox. Same ephemeral-or-existing modes as Run Code. Supports working directory and environment variables. |
| **File** | Upload | Upload an n8n binary field to a sandbox path. Multipart with content-type preservation. |
| | Download | Read a file from a sandbox path and emit it as binary output for downstream nodes. |
| **Git** | Clone | Clone a Git repository into a sandbox path. Supports branch, commit ID pinning, and HTTPS basic auth for private repositories. |

### Operation behavior notes

- **Run Code / Run Command output:** `result` contains stdout and stderr combined. `artifacts` carries any extra metadata Daytona returns (e.g. matplotlib `charts` for Python). Branch on `$json.exitCode` for success/failure — non-zero exit codes are returned as data, not thrown as errors.
- **Ephemeral mode** uses `ephemeral: true` (equivalent to `autoDeleteInterval: 0`) when creating the sandbox; cleanup runs in a `try/finally` so the sandbox is deleted even if the operation throws.
- **Preview URL Signed flavor** embeds the auth token directly in the URL — no need for downstream nodes to add headers. The Standard flavor returns `{ url, token }` separately for callers that prefer header-based auth.
- **Toolbox URL caching** — Daytona returns a per-sandbox `toolboxProxyUrl` from `GET /sandbox/{id}` that all toolbox operations (code/command/file/git) use to route requests. Within a single node execution this URL is fetched once per sandbox and reused for subsequent toolbox operations. The cache is invalidated on Start, Stop, and Delete so that subsequent calls re-fetch the URL and reflect any state change.

### AI Agent integration

This node is marked `usableAsTool: true` and appears in n8n's AI Agent tool picker. Each operation's `description` and `action` strings are exposed to the agent's LLM as tool metadata.

## Examples

Three importable example workflows live in [`docs/examples/`](./docs/examples):

1. [**`run-python-ephemeral.json`**](./docs/examples/run-python-ephemeral.json) — AI agent runs ad-hoc Python in a one-shot ephemeral sandbox. The simplest possible code-execution workflow.
2. [**`clone-build-download.json`**](./docs/examples/clone-build-download.json) — Persistent sandbox: clone a Git repo, run a build command, download the build artifact back to n8n as binary. Good template for CI-style flows.
3. [**`web-app-with-preview.json`**](./docs/examples/web-app-with-preview.json) — Spin up a long-lived sandbox, upload a server script, run it on port 3000, return a signed preview URL. Demonstrates web-service exposure for sharing demos.

To use them: in n8n, click **Workflows → Import from File** and select the JSON. You'll need to configure the Daytona credential after import.

## Compatibility

- **n8n version:** 1.x and later. Tested against the latest stable n8n at the time of release.
- **Node.js:** 20.x and later (matches n8n's runtime requirements).
- **Daytona API:** v1 (current stable as of 2026-05). Self-hosted Daytona instances supported via the **Base URL** credential field.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daytona/n8n-nodes-daytona.git
cd n8n-nodes-daytona
npm install
npm run dev          # boots n8n on http://localhost:5678 with hot reload
```

The dev server symlinks the node into `~/.n8n-node-cli/.n8n/custom/`. First run downloads n8n and takes 1–2 minutes; subsequent runs are fast.

### Tests

```bash
DAYTONA_API_KEY=… npm test
```

Or set values in `.env.local` (gitignored). Set `DAYTONA_TEST_INCLUDE_EPHEMERAL=1` to also run ephemeral-mode tests (creates extra real sandboxes).

The integration suite covers all 12 operations end-to-end against the real Daytona API in ~10 seconds.

### Lint + build

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The lint config is locked by `n8n.strict: true` for n8n Cloud compatibility — don't modify `eslint.config.mjs`.
